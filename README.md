# Generate-TV-Scripts
To generate TV Seinfeld scripts using RNN

## Project Overview

In this assignment, I'll generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
